# Interactive Auction System Proposal

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed enhancements to transform the current basic auction system into a fully interactive, real-time bidding platform that provides an engaging auction experience.

## Current System Analysis

The current auction system is very basic and only allows the admin to:
1. Select a team to sell a player to
2. Set a final price
3. Mark players as unsold
4. Move to the next player

This approach lacks the excitement and engagement of a real auction environment.

## Proposed Interactive Auction System

### 1. **Real-time Bidding Interface**

#### Live Bid Display
- Show current highest bid with team name and amount
- Real-time updates as bids are placed
- Prominent display of current bid amount and team

#### Bid History
- Display recent bids with timestamps
- Show bid progression over time
- Visual timeline of bidding activity

#### Bid Increments
- Automatic bid increment suggestions (e.g., +₹25,000, +₹50,000, +₹100,000)
- Quick bid buttons for common increments
- Custom bid amount input option

#### Timer System
- Countdown timer for each bid round
- Configurable timer duration
- Visual timer display with color changes as time runs out
- Auto-extension when bids are placed near the end

#### Bid Buttons
- Quick bid buttons for standard increments
- "Pass" button for teams to skip current player
- "Auto-bid" option for teams to set maximum bid

### 2. **Team Participation**

#### Team Bidding Cards
- Each team gets a dedicated card showing:
  - Team name and logo
  - Current budget remaining
  - Number of players acquired
  - Current bid status (active/inactive/passed)

#### Active Bid Highlighting
- Highlight the team with the current highest bid
- Visual indicators for teams that have passed
- Color-coded status indicators

#### Budget Warnings
- Visual indicators when teams are low on budget
- Warning messages for insufficient funds
- Budget utilization percentage display

#### Bid History per Team
- Show each team's bidding history for the current player
- Track number of bids placed by each team
- Display maximum bid amount for each team

### 3. **Auction Flow Controls**

#### Start Bidding
- Begin the bidding process for current player
- Initialize timer and bid tracking
- Enable team participation

#### Pause/Resume
- Pause bidding temporarily (for breaks, discussions, etc.)
- Resume bidding with remaining time
- Clear pause/resume indicators

#### Force End
- End bidding immediately and sell to highest bidder
- Override timer for immediate resolution
- Confirm action before execution

#### Pass Functionality
- Allow teams to pass on current player
- Visual indication of passed teams
- Track pass reasons (budget, strategy, etc.)

#### Auto-sell
- Automatically sell when timer expires
- Sell to highest bidder automatically
- Handle ties with admin decision

### 4. **Visual Enhancements**

#### Auction Gavel Animation
- Visual feedback when bids are placed
- Animated gavel effect for winning bids
- Celebration animations for successful sales

#### Team Color Coding
- Use team colors throughout the interface
- Color-coded bid cards and indicators
- Consistent branding across all elements

#### Progress Indicators
- Show auction progress (current player / total players)
- Time remaining indicators
- Budget utilization progress bars

#### Sound Effects
- Optional audio feedback for bids and sales
- Configurable sound settings
- Different sounds for different events (bid placed, timer warning, sale completed)

### 5. **Enhanced Data Structure**

#### New Database Tables

##### Bids Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE bids (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  bid_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ACTIVE', -- ACTIVE, WON, LOST, CANCELLED
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

##### Bid Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE bid_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
  started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  ended_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  winning_bid_id UUID REFERENCES bids(id),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ACTIVE' -- ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
);
```

#### Updated Auction History
- Enhanced auction history with bid details
- Track all bids, not just final sales
- Include timing and bid progression data

### 6. **Admin Controls**

#### Bid Management
- Admin can add/remove bids manually
- Override bid validation when needed
- Correct bid amounts or team assignments

#### Timer Control
- Adjust bid timer duration per player
- Pause/resume timer functionality
- Set different timer durations for different player categories

#### Bid Validation
- Ensure bids meet minimum requirements
- Validate against team budgets
- Check for duplicate or invalid bids

#### Override Capabilities
- Admin can override or correct bids
- Force end bidding sessions
- Manual player assignment when needed
