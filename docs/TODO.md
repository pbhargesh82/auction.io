## 🚨 Risk Management

### Technical Risks & Mitigation:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Supabase API limits** | High | Monitor usage, implement caching, have backup plan |
| **File upload failures** | Medium | Early testing, robust error handling, retry logic |
| **Mobile performance** | Medium | Regular device testing, optimize bundle size |
| **Data corruption** | High | Database backups, validation, transaction safety |

### Timeline Risks & Mitigation:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Scope creep** | High | Stick strictly to MVP features, defer enhancements |
| **Complex debugging** | Medium | Allocate 20% buffer time for each phase |
| **Learning curve** | Medium | Start with simple features, build complexity gradually |
