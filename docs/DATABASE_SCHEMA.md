# üóÑÔ∏è Auction.io Database Schema Design (Supabase PostgreSQL)

## üéØ Database Design Overview

This database schema is designed for a **simplified fantasy sports auction platform** with single admin management. The design focuses on:

- **Single Admin Use**: No complex multi-user authentication
- **Manual Auction Control**: Admin-controlled bidding process
- **Team & Player Management**: Simple CRUD operations
- **Budget Tracking**: Real-time budget calculations
- **Historical Data**: Auction results and analytics

## üìã Detailed Table Specifications

### 1. `teams` - Team Management
**Purpose**: Store team information, logos, and budget tracking

```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    short_name VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    logo_url TEXT,
    primary_color VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#1976d2',
    secondary_color VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#424242',
    budget_cap DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 10000000,
    budget_spent DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
    budget_remaining DECIMAL(12,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (budget_cap - budget_spent) STORED,
    players_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    max_players INTEGER DEFAULT 25,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Constraints
    CONSTRAINT teams_budget_spent_check CHECK (budget_spent >= 0),
    CONSTRAINT teams_players_count_check CHECK (players_count >= 0),
    CONSTRAINT teams_max_players_check CHECK (max_players > 0)
);
```

**Computed Fields:**
- `budget_remaining`: Automatically calculated as `budget_cap - budget_spent`

### 2. `players` - Player Pool Management
**Purpose**: Store all available players for auction

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    subcategory VARCHAR(50),
    base_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 100000,
    image_url TEXT,
    nationality VARCHAR(50),
    age INTEGER,
    experience_years INTEGER,
    stats JSONB, -- Store player statistics as JSON
    is_sold BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Constraints
    CONSTRAINT players_base_price_check CHECK (base_price > 0),
    CONSTRAINT players_age_check CHECK (age > 0 AND age < 100),
    CONSTRAINT players_experience_check CHECK (experience_years >= 0)
);
```

**Example Categories:**
- **Cricket**: Batsman, Bowler, All-rounder, Wicket-keeper
- **Football**: Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper
- **Basketball**: Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, etc.

### 3. `auction_config` - Auction Settings
**Purpose**: Single auction configuration (only one active auction at a time)

```sql
CREATE TABLE auction_config (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    budget_cap DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 10000000,
    max_players_per_team INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 25,
    min_players_per_team INTEGER DEFAULT 15,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'DRAFT' CHECK (status IN ('DRAFT', 'ACTIVE', 'COMPLETED')),
    current_player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
    current_player_position INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_players INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    -- auction_type field removed - timer functionality will be per-player, not per-auction
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Ensure only one active auction at a time
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_auction_config_active ON auction_config (status) 
WHERE status IN ('ACTIVE', 'PAUSED');
```

### 4. `player_queue` - REMOVED
**Purpose**: Auction order management moved to players table

The `player_queue` table has been removed. Auction order is now managed directly through the `auction_status` field in the `players` table.

**Migration Notes:**
- All player queue functionality has been moved to the players table
- The `auction_status` field in players table now handles all queue operations
- This simplifies the database schema and reduces complexity

### 5. `team_players` - Final Team Rosters
**Purpose**: Store final team compositions after auction

```sql
CREATE TABLE team_players (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    purchase_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    purchased_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    position_in_team VARCHAR(50), -- Position assigned in team
    is_captain BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_vice_captain BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    
    -- Ensure player is only in one team
    UNIQUE(player_id),
    
    -- Constraints
    CONSTRAINT team_players_price_check CHECK (purchase_price > 0)
);
```

### 6. `auction_history` - Auction Transaction Log
**Purpose**: Track all auction activities for analytics and history

```sql
CREATE TABLE auction_history (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
    winning_team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
    final_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    auction_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    sold_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    auction_round INTEGER,
    bidding_duration INTERVAL, -- How long the bidding lasted
    notes TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'SOLD' CHECK (status IN ('SOLD', 'UNSOLD', 'WITHDRAWN'))
);
```

### 7. `storage_buckets` - File Storage Configuration
**Purpose**: Supabase storage bucket configuration

```sql
-- This will be created in Supabase Storage, not as a table
-- Buckets: 'team-logos', 'player-images', 'exports'
```

## üîê Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Since this is a single admin application, RLS policies will be simple:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE players ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE auction_config ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE player_queue ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; -- REMOVED
ALTER TABLE team_players ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE auction_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow authenticated users (admin) full access
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON teams
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON players
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON auction_config
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON player_queue
--     FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated'); -- REMOVED

CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON team_players
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON auction_history
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## üìä Database Views for Analytics

    COALESCE(AVG(tp.purchase_price), 0) as avg_purchase_price,
    COALESCE(MAX(tp.purchase_price), 0) as highest_purchase,
    COALESCE(MIN(tp.purchase_price), 0) as lowest_purchase
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN team_players tp ON t.id = tp.team_id
GROUP BY t.id, t.name, t.budget_cap, t.budget_spent, t.budget_remaining, t.players_count;
```

### 2. Auction Progress View

    COUNT(CASE WHEN pq.status = 'UNSOLD' THEN 1 END) as players_unsold,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN pq.status = 'PENDING' THEN 1 END) as players_remaining,
    COALESCE(SUM(ah.final_price), 0) as total_amount_spent,
    ac.current_player_position,
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN pq.status IN ('SOLD', 'UNSOLD') THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(pq.id), 0)) as completion_percentage
FROM auction_config ac
LEFT JOIN player_queue pq ON true
LEFT JOIN auction_history ah ON ah.auction_date = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY ac.id, ac.name, ac.status, ac.current_player_position;
```

### 3. Player Categories Summary
```sql
CREATE VIEW player_category_stats AS
SELECT 
    p.category,
    p.position,
    COUNT(*) as total_players,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.is_sold = true THEN 1 END) as sold_players,
    COALESCE(AVG(tp.purchase_price), 0) as avg_price,
    COALESCE(MAX(tp.purchase_price), 0) as max_price,
    COALESCE(MIN(tp.purchase_price), 0) as min_price
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN team_players tp ON p.id = tp.player_id
GROUP BY p.category, p.position
ORDER BY p.category, p.position;
```
